Online Voting System

The simple ballot-based voting system app is an innovative solution designed to streamline the voting process and make it more accessible and convenient for people. This project aims to develop an easy-to-use mobile application that allows users to cast their votes from the comfort of their homes or offices.

The app will be designed to provide a secure and reliable platform for conducting elections, enabling users to vote without having to visit polling stations physically. The app will also ensure the anonymity of the voters, thus guaranteeing the integrity of the voting process.

The Android Studio platform, a well-liked tool for creating Android-based applications, will be used to build the system. The app will be created to function flawlessly on various Android smartphones, making it available to a variety of users.
